Teaching is not only critical to passing on information and equipping the next generation with tools to succeed in the world, but it also serves to inspire curiosity and can be thought of as a more formal outreach.

[comment]: <> (Research plays a central role in my teaching as students improve their
analytical skills and master the tools of data analysis through hands-on
experience. I have taught undergraduate courses on political violence and
statistical methodology. While at UNC, I taught the graduate statistics lab for
Advanced Topics in Political Data Science, where my work was recognized by the
Political Science Department's Earle Wallace Award for Graduate Student
Teaching. I also served as a teaching assistant for courses in international
relations and American politics at UNC, in addition to the ICPSR Summer Program
where I was a teaching assistant for a course on Bayesian modeling in the social
sciences. I am also a
[certified instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/#jayrobwilliams) with
[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), which develops evidence-based
methods for teaching "essential data and computational skills for conducting
efficient, open, and reproducible research.")
