Welcome! I am a graduate student at UC Berkeley in the [Astronomy Department](https://astro.berkeley.edu/) studying high-energy phenomena in the universe. My [research](research) focuses largely on where the heaviest metals in the universe are produced, elements like gold, silver, and uranium. 

I completed my undergraduate studies in Physics at Northwestern University as part of the the [Integrated Science Program](https://isp.northwestern.edu/) in 2021, and began my PhD at UC Berkeley that fall. When I am not doing research, I love to bake, play TTRPGs and board games, or spend time with my partner and out cat, Basil.
