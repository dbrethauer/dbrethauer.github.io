My academic research focuses on the high-energy astonomical transient called a "kilonova." A kilonova is the light emitted as the result of the radioactive decay of neutron-rich matter generated by the collision of either two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. These collisions are thought to be the dominant sites of where the universe produces the heaviest metals of the periodic tables (though there is still discussion about other possible ways the universe can produce these elements). These elements are produced via [rapid neutron capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-process), otherwise known as r-process.
