When generating a simulation of a kilonova, there are countless assumptions that researchers have to make because we do not have perfect knowledge of the system: what is the density structure of the ejecta, what is the precise elemental composition of the ejecta, what is the r-process heating heat, to name a few. This work focuses on two other assumptions that we have to make in order to simulate a kilonova: the atomic structure of lanthanide elements and the thermalization efficiency.

## Atomic Structure



## Thermalization Efficiency
